<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
[![baby-bear-ecommerce-web-app][ecommerce-screenshot]](https://junchoi0408.github.io/baby-bear-bb-ecommerce-app/) 

The Baby Bear BB Ecommerce App is an E-commerce app that provides high quality, comfortable, and adorable baby clothes. The project began with reducing costs and adding more flexibility to the existing E-commerce website powered by shopify. 

Benefits of developing new E-commerce app:
* There are monthly costs to using prebuilt E-commerce websites using shopify or square. The cost is much higher than using a self-developed website and only paying for what you need! 
* Besides expenses, developing the E-commerce web app provides more flexibility when adding new features.
